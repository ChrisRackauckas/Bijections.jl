Bijections
==========

This package provides a `Bijection` data type for Julia. Please see the
accompanying file `Bijections.pdf` for full details. 

Synopsis
--------

A `Dict` in Julia is not one-to-one. Two different keys might have the same
value. This data structure behaves just like a `Dict` except it blocks
assigning the same value to two different keys.
